Operating System Configuration, Security Implementation & Performance Evaluation Journal

Welcome to my technical journal documenting the full 7-week process of configuring, securing, monitoring, performance testing, and auditing a Linux server operating system.

This project demonstrates my ability to:

🔹 Configure a headless Linux server using the command-line

🔹 Secure the operating system using industry-standard hardening

🔹 Administer the server remotely via SSH

🔹 Implement and verify mandatory security controls

🔹 Analyse system performance under multiple workloads

🔹 Conduct a full system security audit

🔹 Critically evaluate configuration decisions and trade-offs

This journal is published on GitHub Pages as the assessed technical documentation for CMPN2022.

Assessment Overview

This coursework evaluates your ability to configure, secure, and analyse the behaviour of a Linux operating system. All administration is performed using the command-line through remote SSH access.

Assessment Components
✔ Technical Journal (50%) — This website

✔ Recorded Demonstration (50%) — Live CLI walkthrough (to be recorded)
